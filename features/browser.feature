Feature: Browser source map uploads

  Scenario:

    When I run the service "single-source-map-webpack" with the command
      """
      bugsnag-source-maps upload-browser --api-key 123
                                         --source-map dist/main.js.map
                                         --bundle dist/main.js
                                         --bundle-url "http://myapp.url/static/js/main.js"
                                         --endpoint http://maze-runner:9339
      """
#    Then the CLI terminates successfully (zero exitCode)
#    Then the content-type header is form/multipart
#    And the form field sourceMap matches the JSON in fixture xyzÂ¹
#    And the form field minifiedFile is the same as main.js
#    And the payload field "bundleUrl" equals "http://myapp.url/static/js/main.js"
    And I wait to receive 1 request
    And the payload field "apiKey" equals "123"
    And the payload field "appVersion" equals "1.2.3"
    And the payload field "overwrite" is null
